# Mode determines how inputs are mapped:
# mouse|relative|threshold
Mode = "threshold"

# Sensitivity defines the multiplication of the gyroscope data for pixel mouse movement:
Sensitivity = 8.0

# Threshold left and right define the angle thresholds for the corresponding threshold keys to press:
ThresholdLeft = -25
ThresholdRight = 25

ThresholdLeftKey = "a"
ThresholdRightKey = "d"
